# Cereal boxes recognition on shelves

Project for Computer Vision and Image Processing exam @ Unibo

The main task is to deploy computer vision techniques (specifically SIFT detector and Generalised Hough Transform) in order to detect given cereal boxes (models folder) in images of store shelves (scenes folder)
The project is split into 3 steps of increasing complexity:
- one_box.ipynb: unique box detection on one shelf
- multi_box.ipynb: multiple box (of the same type) detection on a shelf
- all_models.ipynb: multiple box detection on all shelves (real case)
