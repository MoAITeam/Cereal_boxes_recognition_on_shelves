# Cereal boxes recognition on shelves

Project for Computer Vision and Image Processing exam @ Unibo

The main task is to deploy computer vision techniques (specifically SIFT detector and Generalised Hough Transform) in order to detect given cereal boxes (models folder) in images of store shelves (scenes folder). The notebooks contain detailed explanations of all the steps involved.

The project is split into 3 steps of increasing complexity:
- single_instance.ipynb: single instance recognition for each model on a shelf
- multiple_instances.ipynb: multiple instances recognition for each model on a shelf
- all_models.ipynb: multiple instances recognition on all shelves (real case)
